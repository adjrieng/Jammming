Hello to whomever will be analyzing my work.

I published the app -> http://efficacious-apparel.surge.sh/ (I feel like I did something wrong in the publishing process and I will have to look this over... That said, it works... meh)

HEADS UP ---> I CHANGED THE PORT TO PORT 3007 in package.json (WHY?... I have multiple servers running and 3K was already being used.... *soooo -> http://localhost:3007/). I feel this was outside of the scope and should be considered as such (despite its slight stature in the scheme of current events, in nature knowing your ports are hella important).

*Techno note, I was actually using IP's instead of 'localhost' because I wanted to test the app on other local devices. As a result of this (also outside of the project scope...) I was able to understand that "window.onload" only works for desktop. This sent me down a rabbit hole for which I am frankly grateful.

Soooo.... I waited till the very last minute because I wanted to implement onEnterSearch (keyTouch feature) as well as localStorage and well, I did. With that said, I wont lie, it took me longer than I would have liked and I ultimately feel like I kinda Hacked and Slashed everything together (so that means much revision... to be expected I guess). Furthermore, I would have liked to have fixed the search and a few other things but more importantly... I wanted to sub something that was beyond the core scope... I did that also.

With that in mind, be gentle.. please ;-)
